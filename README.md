Drunken Tomatoes is a movie collection manager, currently in pre-alpha.

Notes
-----

The application has been designed for personal use, so the design has a few limits:

- although written following secure practices (eg. escaping), it does not try to make potential attacks as difficult as possible (eg. by obfuscating database field names in the HTML)
- the frontend code has a resonable but surely suboptimal design, as I don't enjoy frontend work
- there is no testing
